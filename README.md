# Pkgcraft

Pkgcraft is a highly experimental, rust-based, tooling ecosystem for Gentoo. It
aims to provide bindings for other programming languages targeting
Gentoo-specific functionality as well as a new approach to package management,
leveraging a client-server design that will potentially support various
frontends.

## Components

- **pkgcraft**: core library supporting various Gentoo-related functionality
- **arcanist**: daemon focused on package querying, building, and merging
- **pakt**: command-line client for arcanist

## Development

For bugs and feature requests please create an [issue][1].

Otherwise [discussions][2] can be used for general questions and support.
