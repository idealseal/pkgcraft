# Pkgcraft

Highly experimental tooling ecosystem for Gentoo comprised of the following:

- [scallop]: bash library
- [pkgcraft]: core library
- [pkgcraft-c]: C bindings
- [pkgcraft-tools]: command-line tools
- [pkgcruft]: QA library and tools
- [arcanist]: package-building daemon

More information about the project can be found on its [FAQ] and
[development blog][website].

## Development

Using [cargo-nextest] is required to run tests in separate processes. Running
tests via `cargo test` will break due to its threaded approach since much of
the pkgcraft ecosystem relies on bash which isn't thread-friendly in any
fashion.

In addition, crates with the `test` feature require it to be enabled when
running tests so use `cargo nextest run --all-features --tests` to run tests
for the entire workspace.

For bugs or other requests please create an [issue].

For general support or questions use [discussions] or the #pkgcraft IRC
channel on libera.
